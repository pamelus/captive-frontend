It had to be long because it didn't change - so each neighbor had plenty of time to try to guess it. This caused some problems - most people typed them incorrectly the first time, so you had to start everything from the beginning. Unfriendly user interfaces on mobile devices did not improve the situation - you did not even know where you made the mistake.")}</p>
				<p className="text-justify">{this.props.t("For a change, the token has only a few characters. This can be because it only works for a few minutes after being generated. Thanks to this, it ensures a level of security similar to that of a long password.")}</p>
				<p className="text-justify">{this.props.t("In addition, the token is handled via a friendly web interface, so even if you rewrite it incorrectly, you'll have the chance to see where you made the mistake and quickly correct it.")}</p>
